### Brain Games consists of 5 mini-games related to simple math. 
#

### The project includes the following games:

* Game: **"Even Check"** - The player needs to determine whether a number is even or not.
* Game: **"Calculator"** - The player is shown a random mathematical expression that needs to be evaluated and the correct answer recorded.
* Game: **"GCD"** - "Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)" - The player is shown two random numbers and needs to calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.
* Game: **"Arithmetic Progression"** - The player needs to determine the number hidden by dots ".." among a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression.
* Game: **"Prime or Not"** - The player needs to determine whether a number is "prime" or not.

#
